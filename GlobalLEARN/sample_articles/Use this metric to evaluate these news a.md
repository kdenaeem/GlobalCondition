Hamas says will free 3 more hostages as planned, paving way to resolve ceasefire dispute
Hamas said Thursday (February 13, 2025) it would release three more Israeli hostages as planned, paving the way toward resolving a major dispute over the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.
The militant group had threatened to delay the next release of captives, accusing Israel of failing to meet its obligations to allow in tents and shelters, among other alleged violations of the truce.
Israel, with the support of U.S. President Donald Trump, says it will resume fighting Hamas if the hostages are not freed.
 Hamas says it will release hostages as planned, apparently resolving ceasefire dispute
The announcement from Hamas should allow the ceasefire to continue for now, even after Israel said Thursday (February 13, 2025) that a rocket had been launched from Gaza – though doubts remain about the long-term durability of the truce.
Hamas said it held talks in Cairo with Egyptian officials and was in contact with Qatar’s prime minister about bringing into Gaza more shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble – its key demand in recent days. It said in a statement that the mediators had pledged to “remove all hurdles.”
Shortly after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou confirmed to The Associated Press by phone that three hostages will be released on Saturday (February 15, 2025).
Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV, which is close to the country’s security services, reported that Egypt and Qatar had succeeded in resolving the dispute. The two Arab countries have served as key mediators with Hamas and helped broker the ceasefire, which took effect in January, more than 15 months into the war.
