Factors and weights:
- scale : Global population impact (10=affects all humanity, 5=regional, 2=local)
- impact : Immediate effect strength on humanity's development
- potential : Future influence on human civilization
- legacy : Historical milestone for human progress
- novelty : Uniqueness in human history
- credibility : Source reliability
- positivity : Positive development for humanity

Scale scoring guideline:
10: Affects all of humanity directly
8: Major global impact
6: Multi-region impact
4: Regional impact
2: Local impact

Impact scoring guideline:
10: Immediate global emergency
8: Major global change
6: Significant regional change
4: Moderate regional effect
2: Local effect
